This is a mock education website that I'm creating to sharpen my web dev skills. I'll comment how I created 
the website and list the challenges I faced whilst doing so.

I first created a wireframe of the site on Canva.com to get a rough idea of how the website would be laid out. I then created the boilerplate HTML and added in a mortarboard favicon.
